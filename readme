*launch server
Launch multiple servers by LockService:
java LockService [numOfServer]

Or:
Launch each single server by hand:
java PaxosServer [serverID (starts from 0)] [numOfServer]


*client
As a client, use telnet to connect a specific server
e.g.
telnet 127.0.0.1 2139
(currently the base port is set to be 2139, so this means the first server,
2140 indicates the seconds, and so on)
(may add a configuration file later)

then type command. Each command ends with a carriage return, 13 & 10 in telnet. 
currently command length should be smaller than 30 (another hardcoded arguments)
no space please


*state machine
Currently state machine does nothing but copying the input exactly.
so a client typed "blabla" should expect an output "blabla"


*log
Log information is on stdout currently
